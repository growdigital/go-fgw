# Modular CSS

1. [Frontend build](#1-frontend-build)
2. [CSS Organisation](#2-css-organisation)
3. [Syntax](#3-syntax)
4. [Principles](#4-principles-of-modular-css)


## 1. Frontend build

![Gulp taskrunner logo](/images/gulp.png)

* Modular CSS is a way of organising your CSS, and other assets, into discrete and re‑usable chunks.
* The individual chunks are **concatenated** and **optimised**.
* Indiego uses [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) JavaScript taskrunner.


## 2. CSS Organisation

The CSS organisation is based on [Inverted Triangle CSS](https://github.com/itcss) by [Harry Roberts](https://twitter.com/csswizardry), from the most applicable styles (variables, base) to specific modules (objects and components) and to _very specific_ trumping [utilities](https://github.com/suitcss/utils) and [shameful hacks](https://csswizardry.com/2013/04/shame-css/).

1. **Variables**: global variables and site-wide settings eg `responsive.css`
2. **Base**: unclassed HTML elements eg `a {}`
3. **Objects**: cosmetic-free objects, abstractions, and design patterns eg `o-media.css`
4. **Components**: discrete, complete chunks of UI eg `button.css`
5. **Utilities**: high-specificity, very explicit selectors that trump
everything else. Overrides and helper classes eg `.u-hiddenvisually {}`
6. **Shameful**: _temporarily disorganised_ CSS lives in `shame.css`

**All files relating to a particular module go in that module folder**: eg JavaScript, PNGs, JPEGs, SVGs, CSS, template snippet for styleguide etc. 

### Simplified [directory structure](https://github.com/growdigital/indiego/tree/master/src) 

```
src
├── css
│   ├── settings
│   └── shame.css
├── images
├── js
└── modules
    ├── components
    │   └── forms
    |       └── button
    ├── objects
    └── utilities
```

## 3. Syntax

### Modified BEM syntax

In short:

<span style="color:red; font-size: x-large;">`.block__element--modifier {}`</span>

This is a modified BEM syntax from [@CSSWizardry](https://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/)

```css
.block {}
.block__element {}
.block--modifier {}
```

The `block` is the module (object or component), the `block__element` is a _descendant_ of that module and the `block--modifier` is a variation on that module.

For example:

```css
.search {}
.search__field {}
.search--full {}
```

### BEM ground rules

* Hyphen to separate words in long names & two underscores to separate the name of the block from the name of the element:  
`block-name__element-name`
* CSS class for a block coincides with its block name
* A modifier is a property of a block or an element that alters its look or behavior.
* A modifier has a name and a value. Several modifiers can be used at once.
* Double dash to separate name of block/element from name of modifier:  
`menu menu--big`

### Namespacing

To add clarity to the `block__element--modifier` convention, use “namespacing”: prefixing a module with an identifying character:

```css
.o-object {}
.component {}
.u-utility {}
.js-javascript {}
._-hack {}
.is-state {}, has-state {}
```

For example, `.button {}`, `.o-media {}`, `.u-cf`, `_-messy-hack`. The odd one is out **component** – no `c-` prefix here, because components are the most common type of module, and if it doesn’t have a prefix, it’ll be a component.

## 4. Principles of Modular CSS

### Why Modular CSS?

* Each module is written as _separate_ files in their own directory.
* [Version control](https://git-scm.com/about) is much easier.
* Finding specific modules is simple.
* [Building a style guide](https://fractal.build/guide) requires minimal setup.

### Some key principles

> Build what you need. Start simple. Stay simple.

1. **ID-based CSS selectors must not be used**. IDs have a much higher specificity, which can then lead to all sorts of [specifity wars](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/css_specificity_wars.html) when trying to apply a style.  
2. **HTML elements must not be used in CSS selectors**. This means classes can be applied to _any_ element eg `<input class="button" type="submit">` and `<button class="button">pushme</button>`.
3. **Only use the module for one bit of functionality**. This is the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle).
4. **Class names should be _functional_ & independent of content**. Again, this makes a module _re-usable_ in different contexts.
5. Modules must have **unique names**.

### Visibility

A guiding principle in [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development) development is to **make work visible** (Kanban 看板 literally means billboard in Japanese). To this end, **use a styleguide**, from the beginning. Indiego recommends [Fractal](https://fractal.build/), a magnificent, _automated_, styleguide builder.
