Last weekend we paid a visit to [Colby Woodland Garden](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/colby-woodland-garden) in Pembrokeshire. It was damp and mild, perfect for browsing, trudging and investigating plants. I’m always struck by the variety of forest garden favourites in a ‘traditional’ garden. At Colby, there was a _vast_ number of [Mahonia aquifolium](http://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=mahonia+aquifolium) (Oregon Grapes) and other Mahonia, and my first encounter with the fruit of [Cornus kousa](http://www.pfaf.org/USER/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Cornus+kousa) (Japanese Dogwood)! Bright red, only slightly exaggerated by the instagrammed filter on my phone, soft and yellow inside, with a dozen seeds.

I didn’t eat the fruit, I wasn’t too sure what it was and I thought it was a late summer rather than a winter fruit! I’ll try and propagate them (according to Martin Crawford in [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/) the seeds take 14 weeks of [stratification](https://www.thespruce.com/stratification-seeds-into-thinking-its-winter-1403100)).

The tree/shrub itself is very elegant, we saw a fantastic specimen with beautiful cream flowers at Old Cilgwyn Gardens near Llandyfriog a couple of years ago and last year we planted a Cornus kousa var chinensis from [Ty Rhos Trees](http://www.tyrhostrees.co.uk).

Near the entrance to Colby is a wall and water feature, crowned beautifully with the rampant [Rubus tricolor](http://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Rubus+tricolor) (Chinese Bramble). It looked magnificent, spilling over the edge of the wall in all its evergreen glory. Don’t plant this at home kids, unless you have **plenty** of space. It is so rampant it will even out compete grass.

And finally, one of my favourite ground cover plants, [Vinca minor](http://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Vinca+minor) (Lesser Periwinkle). Thick, glossy foliage, tough as old boots, a really robust and easy to care for plant.
