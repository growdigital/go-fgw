The good people at [The People’s Orchard](https://www.facebook.com/peoplesorchardstdogs/) are very kindly hosting my very first public talk about forest gardening. It’ll be held at [St Dogmaels Abbey](http://www.stdogmaelsabbey.org.uk/contact.php) [SA43 3DX](https://binged.it/2DW5Hb0) in Pembrokeshire, near Cardigan, West Wales.

It’s an introduction to forest gardening, just an hour, so it will be about the principles and our practical experience and gotchas about starting out.

I will be putting the slides online, once I’ve worked out a decent way of storing them.

More details to follow!
