Today was filled with filling in a tax return, the UK deadline looming only days away. I managed to get out into the forest garden for about **10 minutes**, marking out a hedge with ground lime. Oh, sweet blesséd relief. Even 10 minutes away from the desk and the frantic tap-tapping, list checking and administrating was so worth it.

The Shrubbery (did I mention I have no head for creative names?) has had a layer of bark mulch diligently strewn upon its surface and I have started marking up the position of the shrubs. It’s a bit of a tricky situation, a big ash at the bottom of the south-facing slope, so some dry shade to watch out for. I’ll be planting [Symphytum ibericum](https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/details?plantid=1894) (Iberian dwarf comfrey) as a ground cover.

Higher up, there’ll be some red and whitecurrants [Ribes rubrum](http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Ribes+rubrum) (['Versailles'](<https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/116982/Ribes-rubrum-Versailles-Blanche-(W-C)/Details>) and ['Jonkheer Van Tets'](https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/details?plantid=5797)), a couple of [Chaenomeles japonica](http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Chaenomeles+japonica), a [Zanthoxylum schinifolium](http://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Zanthoxylum+schinifolium) and a [Cephalotaxus Harringtonia](http://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Cephalotaxus+harringtonia). With a couple of [lime trees](http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Tilia+cordata) and [white mulberry](http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=morus+alba) as coppiced leaf crops at the top, there isn’t much space for anything elase

I have been using [QCAD](http://www.qcad.org/en/) for my planning but it is obvious that **the map is not the territory**. The Ordnance Survey map is a few metres out, so I use it more as a _guide_ and less as an _instruction_. Out in the field, I’m using bits of bamboo and a bucket of ground lime to mark out the circumference of the plants. Together with windbreaks, rabbit fencing, soil preparation and mulching, correct spacing is up there in the Top 5 List of Things To Consider.
